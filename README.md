# AES_Encr_Decr
Making use of Java's integrated JCE (Java Cryptographic Extensions) to simulate AES-128 algorithm for simple encryption and decryption of user entered data.

## Input specifications: 
* User must enter a fixed length of string as ‘plain text’
* The ‘plaintext’ must be entered in the appropriate input field.
* The ‘plaintext’ entered has no restriction on any type of characters. 

## Output Specifications: 
* The output i.e. Encrypted text must follow AES-128 algorithm for encryption. 
* The security key must NOT be displayed by the module.
